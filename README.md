# xmr_haystack

## Description

(stealth addresses) were used as decoys.

## Disclaimer

While this program works, it is still in *very* early dev stages, and some of the command-line arguments are non-functional.
The ones listed in the README should be valid. Use this program at your own risk; I take no responsibility for any lost funds
or privacy, etc, etc. That said, I really hope you find this code useful and I would really appreciate any feedback. :)
